# Assignment 6: Signals

Frameworks like Vue uses Ref to create a reactive reference that can be used to notify subscribers when a value changes. In other frameworks that concept is called signals.

Signals are a way to notify subscribers when a value changes, but they are not a primitive part of the JavaScript language. A proposal for that is currently being discussed by the TC39 committee (see: [TC39  Signals proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals)).

To understand signals better you can watch the video below, but know that since signals are not part of the JavaScript language yet, we will not use them in this course.

But with signals we would run into the same architectural issues as with custom events, that's another reason why we will not use them in this course.
